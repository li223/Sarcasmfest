"tHiS rEpO dOeSnT aLiGn WiTh OuR cOrE vAlUeS" - This quote brought to you by the hacktoberfest team TM.

Basically this repo is mocking them as some repos they've marked as spam were merely aimed at getting beginners into OSS and Hacktoberfest itself (See RaidAndFade's challenges).

# What do I do
Commit a program that converts "This repo does not align with our core values" into what I've dubbed SaRcAsM cAsE, in the most efficient way you can.

# Note
If you're one of the like 3 people that contributed before, you can contribute again. Just add `-2022` to the file name or something idk.

~~Also forgot you can't commit to your own repos so lol that was a meme moment~~ nope you actually can.
